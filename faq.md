## Powering Vertigo

### Can I use a different battery with VertigoIMU? ###

You must use a 1S (3.7V) lithium polymer (LiPo) or lithium ion (Li-Ion) battery
with Vertigo. We recommend a capacity of at least 800mAh.

### How long does Vertigo take to charge? ####

Using the supplied battery, expect a charge time of around 8 hours.

### How long does Vertigo run from its battery? ###

Using the supplied battery, expect run time of around 3 hours. For this reason,
it's best to power down Vertigo when you're not using it.

## Using Vertigo

### When I power up Vertigo, all 4 LEDs flash once per second. ### 

This is the low battery warning. Please [charge Vertigo](usage.md).

### When I power up Vertigo, LED1 and LED4 flash fast alternately. ###

This is the error sequence, it means something is preventing Vertigo from
starting normally. Please check the troubleshooting section [here](usage.md).
