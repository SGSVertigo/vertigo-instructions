**Note:** The LEDs will flash twice indicating the battery level. If 4 LEDs
flash, the battery is fully charged. If only 1 or 2 flash, you should charge
your Vertigo soon.

4. LED1 begins to flash slowly indicating Vertigo has passed its self-test and
is ready. LED2 flashes fast whilst Vertigo is searching for a GPS lock.
