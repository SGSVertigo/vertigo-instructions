##The new academic year begins.
 


Working tirelessly over the summer [JonSowman](https://twitter.com/jonsowman) has produce twelve awesome Vertigos.  One for him, ten for schools and one for me.  Overcoming a slight [mishap](http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/spook-hill-north-holmwood-closed-13666823) at his local post office, the units are ready to ship out to our excited schools.

At present, three schools, beyond the Sutton IRIS hub, have started the journey to Vertigo data analysis.  This involves installing matlab and reviewing a few test files.  Not a completely trivial exercise.  So, taking Jon’s lead, I developed a [webpage](https://sgsvertigo.github.io/vertigo-instructions/VertigoIMU_Data_analysis_with_Matlab.html) to lead schools through, step by step, the nuances of matlab’s graph plotting functions.
Results from our own preliminary experiments have been very encouraging.  Vertigo continues to amaze all those who have seen it in action.  


The webpage has proved successful with other schools and they are now ready to take their own data files.
In particular, Cokethorpe school have strong links with the RAF at Brize Norton.  Could they get a Vertigo on an RAF plane?

 Vertigo on a jet?         |  Dr Grubisic


Here, we are eagerly waiting for data files to come through from Dr Angelo Grubisic of Southampton University and the Icarus project.  Angelo, took a vertigo out on one of his wing-suit flights and is keen for pupils to delve into this data for one key variable.  More on this in next month’s instalment.

We also have pupils heading off to Thorpe Park for a second round of data acquisition.  The Colossus looks to be the ride of choice for data taking.  Results will be published for the first time at the [Young Scientists Journal conference](https://events.ysjournal.com/) in Oxford on 12TH October.

Promising links have also been developed with St Anne’s at Oxford where their rowing team are interested in a school looking into some data for them- any advantage over the competition.

Other sporting suggestions continue to roll in.  One person recently suggested we contact British pair, Penny Coomes and Nick Bucklan, who, just last week, won their place at the Winter Olympics in South Korea 2018 .  Vertigo on the leg of a skater completing a triple salchow would be quite something. I am looking for schools to Volunteer.
